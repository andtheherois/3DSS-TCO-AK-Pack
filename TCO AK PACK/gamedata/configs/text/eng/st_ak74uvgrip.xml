		<text>Like its parent rifle, the Kalash (AK-74M), the AKSU fires a 5.45x39mm cartridge. Its description is misleading as the AKSU is exactly as accurate as the Kalash. [Source] The AKSU has a slightly higher rate-of-fire and a faster aim-down-sights time, making it an effective emergency weapon when facing enemies at close-range.\n \n
