		<text>The RGM-40 grenade launcher is a stand-alone version of the Russian GP-30 grenade launcher with a telescoping stock, AK-type pistol-grip and flip-up tangent sights. It is a single-shot muzzle loaded weapon with a self-cocking trigger mechanism and offers a high degree of commonality with the GP-30. It was designed primarily for police use and can use a wide range non-lethal ammunition.\n \n
